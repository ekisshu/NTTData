Assignment:

Ansible ( 2.5+) has recently released a module for terraform. 
Please create an Ansible playbook to deploy terraform projects including deciding 
appropriate parameters to provide a good balance between usability and customizability. 
This playbook is intended to be run within a Jenkins pipeline (create a Jenkins pipeline if needed). 
Think about it as a generic playbook to deploy any terraform project. The idea is to have various capabilities like:
Ability to set backend configuration during runtime
Ability to pass terraform variables through ansible vars Have a way to create:
Only terraform plan and not execute it (for example, this can be used to create a manual approval stage)
Create the plan and execute it
Just execute a plan that has been created earlier
